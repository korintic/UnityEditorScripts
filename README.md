# Unity Editor Scripts
Collection of simple Unity editor scripts written to improve workflow and learn C# and Unity editor scripting at the same time.

## Editor Scripts
These scripts work when they are located in an Editor folder in a Unity project.

### Capture

Uses camera with MainCamera tag.
Can take oversized screenshots, capture transparency and capture from Scene View.

Capture is for taking screencaptures with a hotkey using the current preferences set.

TO DO:
- [ ] See if the code can be simplified/ cleaned up
- [ ] Reorganize layout groups

### SceneViewParent
For parenting objects while working in the SceneView.
Parents selected objects to the active object when SceneView is the active view.

TO DO:
- [ ] Add proper support for Undo

### Snapshot Mesh
Work in progress version of an editor script for taking snapshots of skinned meshes.

TO DO:
- [ ] Clean up/ simplify code
- [ ] Add support for material duplication when keep rig selected
- [ ] Add Editorprefs support
- [ ] Rethink naming of new assets
- [ ] Check if assets paths are valid before doing any operations
- [ ] Study how to properly deleted script components that are depended on each other
- [ ] Make relationship of preferences obvious (which ones are relevant in which cases)
- [ ] Add support for Undo

### Control RectTransform
For bypassing the Unity bug that sometimes recttransform fields stay locked if you delete a layout element or group component.
Issue tracker shows that this bug should be fixed by Unity in 2018.3 beta but this editor script offers a workaround for other versions of Unity.
Target Transform fields updates the transforms imidiately and Source Transform allows for setting specific values before applying them.

Note: The anchor preset window is not functional on the custom editor window.
Note: Another possibly approach for bypassing this bug would have been to rebuild the affected gameobject to get the fields unlocked.
